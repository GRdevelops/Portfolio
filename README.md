# PrimoPiano Luxury Accommodations

PrimoPiano Luxury Accommodations is an accommodation rental business in Vieste. They asked for my help to refurbish their website. I used an Envato template and modified it, creating tailored additional pages and sections. I then integrated their booking engine to keep functionalities such as online reservations. It is a fully functional website. Some challenges encountered were: hosting, migration, accessibility, performance optimization and SEO. This was my first coding project.

## Deployment
This website is live at https://www.primopianovieste.it/
