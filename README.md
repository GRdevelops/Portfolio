# Front-End Developer

## Introduction
Welcome to my personal front-end developer portfolio. This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website.

This portfolio rapresents myself and my way of thinking. I like technically functional, light, performant and accessible interfaces with a time-less, minimal, yet visually pleasing look and an intuitive user experience. Typography, sound responsiveness, scalability, and attention to details in general. 

Hopefully you like it, if not, I respect anybodies style and tastes. What's important to me, is that I can showcase my skills well and give as much essential information as possible to potential employers and clients that don't have much time to waste across millions of existing options.
